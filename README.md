# Angular Forms Generator

Angular Forms Generator is a web-based tool which utility is basically generate an entire Angular Component (template and controller) which contains a fully implemented reactive form.
 
You simply choose all the labels/inputs names you want and it generates you all the component code; this can help you with all the boilerplate code you could have to write.
 
 
> By now, the generated HTML templates are written using Bootstrap 4 classes, and all the generated inputs are fluids (100% width);
